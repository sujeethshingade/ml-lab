0  Sunny        Warm     High    Weak        Yes
1  Sunny        Warm     High  Strong        Yes

Running Find-S algorithm...

Final Hypothesis:
〈Sky = Sunny, Temperature = Warm, Humidity = High, Wind = ?, 〉

Hypothesis Interpretation:
- '?' means any value is acceptable for that attribute
- 'ϕ' means no value has been observed (null)
- Specific values indicate required values for that attribute
